Project Explanation:
This project involves developing a Python script that dynamically identifies the operating system in use and delivers corresponding system details. For instance, if executed on Windows, it reveals Windows-specific details, and if on Linux, it presents Linux-specific information. Network data such as private and public IP addresses, along with the default gateway, are also displayed. Disk statistics including the hard disk size, free and used space are provided. Furthermore, the script lists the five largest directories by size and monitors CPU usage, refreshing the statistics every ten seconds for real-time monitoring.
